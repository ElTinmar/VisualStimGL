This repository is a playground to create visual stimuli using opengl.

 # Ideas

 - Klein bottle
 - MÃ¶bius strip
 - Trefoil Knot
 - Particle effects 
 - Ising model
 - Segregation ?

# TODO

- The behavior of sqrt for negative numbers is unspecified.
Some implementation may use abs. Make sure you define 
the intended behavior in your shader

- send (window size / time / mouse) as uniforms to the fragment shader

- normalize the coordinates in the fragment shader at the beginning?
