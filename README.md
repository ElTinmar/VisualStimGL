# Fun with GL Shaders

This repository is a playground to create visual stimuli using opengl.

# Resources

 # Ideas

 - Klein bottle
 - MÃ¶bius strip
 - Trefoil Knot
 - Heart
 - Cat 
 - Particle effects ?
 - parametric curve in 3D like 3B1B fourier   

# TODO

- The behavior of sqrt for negative numbers is unspecified.
Some implementation may use abs. Make sure you define 
the intended behavior in your shader

- send (window size / time / mouse) as uniforms to the fragment shader
